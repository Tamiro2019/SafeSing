# SafeSing : Leveraging A.I. to balanced your technique

SafeSing is a [web app](http://18.232.171.164/) designed to help inexperienced singers identify problem areas in their voice and promote healthy singing. Most aspiring singers decide to teach themselves because professional vocal lessons are expensive (often more than 100$ per hour). Left unchecked, improper technique can lead to vocal damage such as vocal nodules and polyps. SafeSing supports learning singers by providing immediate and accurate feedback on the way in their vocal cords are coordinating to produce sound (i.e. their phonation modes). The SafeSing app takes a sung recording as input and classifies half second bins into one of three categories indicating the phontation mode: Breathy, Balanced, or Pressed.
